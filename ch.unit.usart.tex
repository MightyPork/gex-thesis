The USART unit provides access to one of the microcontroller's USART peripherals. All USART parameters can be configured to match the application's needs. 

The clock output and hardware flow control may be enabled, as well as the Driver Enable (DE) output used by RS485 transceivers to switch between a reception and transmission mode.
