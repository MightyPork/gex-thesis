The NeoPixel unit implements the protocol needed to control a digital LED strip with WS2812, WS2811, or compatible LED driver chips. The protocol timing is implemented in software, therefore it is available on any GPIO pin of the module. The unit accepts sequences of RGB color values from the host and loads them into the LED strip.
