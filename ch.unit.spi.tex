\section{SPI Unit}

The SPI unit provides access to one of the microcontroller's SPI peripherals. It can be configured to use any of the different speeds, clock polarity and phase settings available in its control registers. The unit handles up to 16 slave select (NSS) signals.

Both write-only and read-write (query) transactions are implemented.
