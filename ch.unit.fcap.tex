\section{Frequency Capture Unit}

The frequency capture unit implements both the frequency measurement methods explained in \cref{sec:theory-fcap}: direct and reciprocal.

The unit has several operational modes: idle, reciprocal continuous, reciprocal burst, direct continuous, direct burst, free counting, and single pulse. Burst mode is an on-demand measurement with optional averaging. Continuous mode doesn't support averaging, but the latest measurement can be read at any time without a delay.

\subsection{Value Conversion Formulas}

Several of the features implemented in this unit would require floating point arithmetic to provide the measured value in the desired units (Hz, seconds). That is not available in Cortex-M0, only as a software implementation. The calculation is left to the client in order to save Flash space that would be otherwise used by the the arithmetic functions. This arrangement also avoids rounding errors and a possible loss of precision.

\subsubsection{Reciprocal (Indirect) Measurement}

Period (in seconds) is computed as:

\[
	T = \dfrac{\mathrm{period\_sum}}{f_\mathrm{core,MHz} \cdot 10^6 \cdot \mathrm{n\_periods}}
\]

\noindent
The frequency is obtained by simply inverting it: \[f=T^{-1}\]

The average duty cycle is computed as the ratio of the sum of active-level pulses and the sum of all periods:

\[\mathrm{average\_duty} = \dfrac{\mathrm{ontime\_sum}}{\mathrm{period\_sum}}\]

\subsubsection{Direct Measurement}

The frequency can be derived from the pulse count and measurement time using its definition ($t_\mathrm{ms}$ is measurement time in milliseconds):

\[f = \dfrac{1000\cdot\mathrm{count}\cdot\mathrm{prescaller}}
{t_\mathrm{ms}}\]



\subsection{Frequency Capture Configuration}

\begin{inicode}
[FCAP:j@10]
# Signal input pin - one of:
#  Full support:  A0, A5, A15
#  Indirect only: A1, B3
pin=A0

# Active level or edge (0-low,falling; 1-high,rising)
active-level=1
# Input filtering (0-15)
input-filter=0
# Pulse counter pre-divider (1,2,4,8)
direct-presc=1
# Pulse counting interval (ms)
direct-time=1000

# Mode on startup: N-none, I-indirect, D-direct, F-free count
initial-mode=N

Some commands include optional parameter setting. Using 0 in the field keeps the previous value. Those fields are marked with *.
