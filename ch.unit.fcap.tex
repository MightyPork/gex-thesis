\section{Frequency Capture Unit}

The frequency capture unit implements both the frequency measurement methods explained in section \ref{sec:theory-fcap}: direct and reciprocal. It can be operated in an on-demand or continuous measurement mode. The unit can be switched to two other modes: pulse counter, and the measurement of a single pulse.
