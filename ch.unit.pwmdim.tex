\section{PWM Unit}

The PWM unit uses a timer/counter to generate a PWM signal. There are four outputs with a common frequency and phase, but independent duty cycles. Each channel can be individually enabled or disabled.

This unit is intended for applications like light dimming, heater regulation, or the control of H-bridges.
