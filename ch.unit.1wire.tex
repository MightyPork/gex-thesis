\section{1-Wire Unit}

The 1-Wire unit implements the Dallas Semiconductor's 1-Wire protocol, most commonly used to interface smart thermometers (DS18x20). The protocol is explained in section \ref{sec:theory-1wire}. This unit implements the basic protocol, as well as the ROM Search algorithm used to recognizes all unique 1-Wire devices connected to the bus.
