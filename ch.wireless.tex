\chapter{Wireless Interface}

Four methods of a wireless connection have been considered: bluetooth (e.g. CC2541), WiFi with ESP8266, LoRA or GFSK with SX1276, and a 2.4\,GHz radio link with NRF24L01+. Bluetooth was dismissed early for its complexity and ESP8266 for its high consumption in continuous reception mode, although both solutions might be viable for certain applications and with more time for evaluation. The SX1276 and NRF24L01+ have both been tested using the first GEX prototype, confirming its usefulness as a hardware development tool.
